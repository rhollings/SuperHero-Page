The process: 
  After creating the base html setup, I then linked a search bar to the top of the page. The search bar then requests information (or names) from the api database as the user types. Once the user begins the search, charaters will begin to cascade onto the page. This is done by creating a div under the search bar. The user can now click on a character showing the stats of said character. This is down with HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Enjoy 😊

  I am very interested into comics and animation, making this project very excited. My plan was to use the given API to show the characters available by typing in a search bar. Second, because the API comes with 'stats', what better display to use than a card (like trading cards). This way the user can see the character searched and stats alongside.

  My original plan <a href="https://github.com/rhollings/web_design/tree/main/front-end/project1" target="_blank">here</a> shows how I previously wanted to do the layout of the page.

It is a databse with even more characters from even more worlds 🤩</p>
